# chromiumOS-web
A recreation of chromiumOS in HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Why?
Why not?!

# What's included?
A chromiumOS based interface and look.

# Known issues
- launcher and most of the quick settings do not work
- tote does not work
- most websites dont work in chromium (literally unfixable)  
if you do end up seeing a bug (not on here perferably), please make a github issue!

# how to use/fork
1. just download the source code, open index.html, push the funny button, and there you go.
2. just fork it and make whatever changes you want. you may have to change some css settings
3. no size worries! the source code is only arround 500kb~ or so, which should not be a huge deal.

# resolution
i know i know, its 640x480. i may add additional resolutions in a later feature update, but for now just deal with it. i highly recommend __not__ full screening/maximizing the window since things will not look right.
